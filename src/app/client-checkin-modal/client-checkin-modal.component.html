            <p>Start from scratch with a fresh, clean slate for your automation and add your own triggers and
              actions.</p>

            <h3>Product Interest Targeted Follow-up</h3>
            <p>Deliver messages that align with the product a contact is interested in. It begins when a product
              interest tag is applied. It should send content and offers that are related to that product interest
              so you can strengthen your relationship
              with the contact and incentivize them to make a purchase.</p>

            <h3>Part 1 - Engagement Tagging</h3>
            <p>Keep up-to-date tags on your contacts based on their engagement level. These tags are useful for
              analytics, segmentation, and list hygiene. Import Part 1 of this two part automation first. Both
              automations must be imported for them
              to work.</p>

            <h3>Product Interest Tagging</h3>
            <p>Tag contacts who have repeatedly visited a product page on your website. If they visit the product
              page two to five times they are tagged as "Interested in Product X." If they visit six or more times
              they are tagged as "Very interested
              in Product X." Use these tags to segment and send targeted offers. Set up Site Tracking before you
              import this recipe.</p>

            <h3>Upgrade Incentive and Outreach</h3>
            <p>Send a series of emails to contacts that have viewed your upgrade page. The automation ends when
              they have made a purchase. This begins a conversation with your contact giving you a chance to
              address their concerns. You also gain valuable
              insight into your customers' pre-purchase hang-ups, so that you can improve your marketing copy and
              purchase process.</p>

            <h3>Accessory Upsell After Purchase</h3>
            <p>Make sure your contacts have everything they need to complete their product experience. If a
              customer purchases a product, but does not purchase the accessory, send them an email to ask if they
              want to add that accessory item to their
              order before it ships. You may want to incentivize this with a coupon or free shipping.</p>

            <h3>"Forward a Campaign" Incentive</h3>
            <p>Reward your contacts for forwarding your email campaigns. Once a contact forwards your campaign,
              they will get an email with a coupon or other offer. To encourage this, you could place a call to
              action at the bottom of all your email
              campaigns. The incentive will encourage sharing and increase purchase frequency.</p>

            <h3>"Share a Campaign on Social Media" Incentive</h3>
            <p>Reward your contacts for sharing your campaign on social media. To encourage this, include a call
              to action at the bottom of your email campaigns. Once a contact shares the campaign on social media,
              they get an email with the incentive
              offered. Rewarding them with a coupon will motivate them to share and increase purchase frequency.

            <h3>Invite to Follow When Referred by a Social Media Site</h3>
            <p>If a contact visits your site from a social media service (like Twitter or Facebook), send an email
              inviting them to follow you on social media. You could easily add additional social networks—just
              make sure to use the referring domain
              (as it is often not the domain of the network’s website). Set up Site Tracking before importing this
              recipe.</p>

            <p>Stay organized and on top of follow-up for your open deals. When a contact with an open deal emails
              you, automatically create a task that reminds you to reply. Before importing this recipe, you'll
              need to connect your email account
              (Settings > Deals > Add IMAP Account).</p>

            <h3>Re-engagement Campaign Triggered by "Disengaged" Tag</h3>
            <p>When a contact is tagged as “Disengaged,” send a re-engagement campaign. If they don't open or
              click a link within that re-engagement campaign, it will unsubscribe them. This will keep your
              deliverability high and prevent you from
              annoying people who aren't interested in what you send.</p>

            <h3>"Need Help?" Message Triggered on Visit to Help Docs</h3>
            <p>Send out a "How can I help you?" email after a contact visits your help documentation. If they are
              a customer, they get an email from customer support. If they aren't a customer, they get an email
              (replies go to your sales team).</p>

            <h3>Customer Service Follow-up</h3>
            <p>If a contact is given the tag "Customer service follow-up," a follow-up email is sent after one
              day. If the customer clicks the "not resolved" link, it will tell your support team to reach out to
              them, and redirect the contact to a
              form to collect more information. If they click the "resolved" link, it will remove the tag. You
              could apply the "Customer service follow-up" tag with Zapier by integrating with your help desk app.

              opt-in subscribers. The messages in the ecourse give you a chance to provide helpful information.
              This will help you strengthen your relationship
              with the contact, position you as an expert, and give you an opportunity to introduce your products
              or services.</p>

              contact information and then deliver the opt-in incentive automatically when they are subscribed.
              You can offer a free ebook, whitepaper,
              or video. The more valuable it is, the better it will work.</p>

            <p>If someone returns to your site over and over, it's safe to assume they're a fan. Apply a tag to
              keep track of repeat visitors. You could use this tag to begin a follow-up sequence that nurtures
              the relationship and encourages advocacy.</p>

            <p>Maximize your webinar attendance by using this automation to remind your contacts it's coming. In
              this example, reminders are sent at 30 days, 14 days, 7 days, the day before, and day of the
              event—but you could easily modify it to
              whatever intervals you think will work best. Before importing this recipe, build a Date-based Custom
              Field for the webinar date.</p>

            <p>When a “Canceled” tag is applied to a contact due to them cancelling your service, send emails that
              invite the customer to return. The messages are delivered at intervals after canceling and can be
              edited to what makes sense for your
              business. You could apply the "Canceled" tag with a service such as Zapier.</p>

              message with a little more depth. If not,
              we’ll send them a reworking of the welcome email with a new subject line and slightly different
              messaging.</p>

              store specific data on each deal allowing informed decisions regarding your sales funnel. Before

            <h3>Won Deal Metrics</h3>
            <p>Upon winning a deal, the deal owner is sent an email containing a form link to identify what drove
              the sale. This information is then added to the won deal and can be used to further shape your
              evolving sales plan. Before importing
              this recipe, build the following: ActiveCampaign form, Won Reason deal custom field of your chosen
              type, Won Reason contact custom field of the same type.</p>

            <h3>Lost Deal Metrics</h3>
            <p>When a deal is marked Lost, send out an email to the contact thanking them for their time and
              asking them to fill out a short survey of what were the factors in their decision. You could use
              this data to further shape your evolving
              sales plan. Alternatively, you could use a Notify Someone step instead of the Send Email step to ask
              the deal owner if you would prefer not to follow up with a lost deal directly. Before importing this
              recipe, build the following:
              ActiveCampaign Form, Lost Reason deal custom field of your chosen type, Lost Reason contact custom
              field of the same type.</p>

            <h3>Notify When Deal Has Not Closed</h3>
            <p>Alert your deal owner when a deal has not closed by your anticipated close date. This allows the
              deal owner to then either double down their efforts to win the deal, denote a cold lead, or mark the
              deal as lost. A tag is then added
              that the deal exceeded the forecast so that the expected close time can be realistically adjusted.
              Before importing this recipe, build the following: A date-based deal custom field for expected close
              date.</p>

            <p>Update deal fields when their corresponding contact custom field is updated, such as with a form
              submission. This allows you to store updated data on each deal to make informed decisions regarding
              your sales funnel.</p>

            <h3>Tagging Based on Custom Fields</h3>
            <p>After a form submit, the contact will travel down a series of actions that check for the value in
              the selected form field. A tag is then generated based on the value present in the custom field.
              Before importing this recipe, build
              the following: ActiveCampaign form.</p>

            <p>Send out an email to contacts who abandon a cart. Include an Abandoned Cart block in the email sent
              out to show the product information of what they had abandoned. This is a powerful tool to
              incentivize contacts to finish their purchase.
              eCommerce integration is required.</p>

            <h3>Frequently Abandoned Cart Notification</h3>
            <p>Tag contacts who have abandoned a cart one or more times. If they abandon the cart three or more
              times without ever making a purchase, it notifies you via email and creates a task to call the
              contact and help answer any questions they
              may have.</p>

            <h3>First Time Abandon Cart Hook</h3>
            <p>Offer contacts who abandon a cart for the first time a special deal to recover the cart. If they
              trigger the automation again by abandoning a cart, they are sent a message about the abandoned cart,
              but not the special offer. This creates
              an opportunity to convert first time contacts to customers.</p>

            <h3>After Purchase Follow Up</h3>
            <p>After a contact purchases a product from you, you can begin an automated follow up sequence that
              increases satisfaction by helping a new customer gain as much value as possible from their purchase.
              Also known as an onboarding sequence,
              you can make the new customer aware of resources available to them, such as help documents and
              support channels. You can give them tips and tricks for getting started, and then send advanced
              suggestions for getting the most out of
              it.</p>

            <h3>Store Last Purchase Date</h3>
            <p>This simple automation stores the date of the last purchase. This is useful for triggering other
              automations based on the date of last purchase. The next automation uses this date field to remind
              someone it’s time to make another purchase.
              You can set an “Advanced” condition on this automation’s trigger so that it only stores the date of
              a certain product. Build a date-based custom field before importing this recipe.</p>

            <h3>Reminder to Re-purchase</h3>
            <p>If you have a product that needs to be replenished after a certain amount of time, you can send a
              campaign to remind someone that it’s probably time to reorder. This can help you decrease the time
              between purchases and increase customer
              lifetime value. This automation is triggered by a date field. You’ll need a custom date field that
              stores the date of last purchase. You may want to give an incentive to motivate them to make the
              purchase now rather than putting
              it off.</p>

              certain product. It can help people stay on your site rather than seeking out third-party reviews
              before making a purchase.</p>

              learn about an annoyance during the checkout process, find discrepancies in expectations on shipping
              times, or gain valuable insight
              you can leverage during your new customer onboarding. Your unhappy customers will help you improve
              your business and your happy customers will give you testimonials you can leverage to make your
              marketing more effective.</p>

              notify an employee or third-party, such as a drop-shipper to get an item in the mail. This simple
              automation sends a notification that will
              attach details about the contact who made the purchase. You can specify which products trigger the
              automation by using the segmenting options.</p>

              encourage them to evangelize. This automation is triggered by the fifth purchase, but it could just
              as easily be triggered by a certain
              revenue amount by modifying the Advanced condition on the trigger.</p>

              information important to them. You
              could specify your contact’s industry, send specified product information, or gauge how familiar
